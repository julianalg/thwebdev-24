You're familiar with the Frontend, which represents what you see in classrooms – desks, boards, and teachers. Now, let's explore the Backend, which is like the main office managing all the school's information behind the scenes.

### 🏠 Servers - The House's Functionality
Imagine servers as your house's brain. They make everything in your house work, like turning on lights, keeping the rooms cool, and making sure stuff runs smoothly. When you want a light on, the brain (server) sends power to the light so it shines.

### 🪑 Databases - The House's Resources
Databases are like different energy companies delivering specific resources to your house. Each company supplies something different, just as databases hold various kinds of organized information. For example, one energy company might provide electricity, another gas, and another water. Similarly, different databases supply specific data types, keeping things organized like resources from different companies.

### 💡 RESTful - Controlling Household Systems
RESTful is like the method we use to interact with things in the house. Similar to how you might switch on lights, turn on the faucet for water, or adjust the thermostat to get hot water or change room temperature, RESTful is a way to allows us to access and receive things from the household system.
