# What is the Backend?
You're familiar with the Frontend, which represents what you see in classrooms – desks, boards, and teachers. Now, let's explore the Backend, which is like the main office managing all the school's information behind the scenes.

1. Servers - The School's Main Office
Servers act as the school's main office. They handle all the school's data – student records, schedules, grades, and more. Just like the main office keeps everything organized and secure, servers store and manage vast amounts of information for the website.

2. Databases - Organized Office Filing System
Databases are like the organized filing cabinets in the main office. They store specific types of information neatly arranged and easily retrievable. Each cabinet (database) holds various folders (data) categorically, making it simple to find what's needed, much like how the office keeps files organized.

3. RESTful - Submitting an Online Assignment
RESTful is similar to submitting an assignment online. When you submit an assignment, you use a specific form or platform. This form (RESTful) allows you to securely send your work (data) to the teacher (server) through the school's system (Backend). Just like how submitting an assignment online ensures your work reaches the teacher smoothly and securely, RESTful enables different parts of the school (like departments or systems) to exchange information efficiently and securely.

So, while the Frontend gives you the classroom experience, remember there's a sophisticated system (Backend) managing everything behind the scenes, much like the main office handles and organizes the school's information.
