## Internet and Web Development
The Internet is like a huge worldwide network that connects millions of devices together. It's a bit like a massive library, but instead of books, it stores information, pictures, videos, and much more. You can think of it as a place where people from all over the world can share and access information.

Websites are like individual rooms or spaces in this big library. Each website has its own unique address, just like a house has an address in a city. When you visit a website, you're exploring what's inside that particular room of the internet library. Websites can be about anything â€“ from sharing news and stories, selling products, teaching things, or simply entertaining people.

Now, web development is the fascinating process of building these websites. It's like being an architect, designer, and storyteller all at once. People who work on web development use special computer languages and tools to create and design these online spaces.
