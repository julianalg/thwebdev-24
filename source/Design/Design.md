Now, let's dive into why design is a big deal in web development. 

Imagine a house that's basically impossible to live in. The kitchen is on the 2nd floor, bathrooms are on the first floor, and the bedrooms are tucked away in the basement – a total mess! Living there would be a real headache. Imagine having to climb up to the first floor every time you need the restroom, just because your room is in the basement. Plus, all the cooking happens on the 2nd floor. It's like a daily obstacle course! 😅 

In the web world, bad design is a bit like this crazy house layout – it makes things awkward and inconvenient for everyone. Therefore, the goal of design is to make our home as easy to use and navigate, accessible for everyone, and make it as attractive as possible. 🏠✨

So when creating our website, we have to consider two main things:
- User Experience
- User Interaction

Let's find out what they mean!

### 🌐 User Experience (UX) - Shaping the House's Feel
Think of UX as the interior design of your house. It's about creating a space where everyone feels comfortable and can easily find what they need. In web development, UX is all about putting things on a website in a way that makes it easy and fun to use. It's like setting up a cool online space, arranging stuff so that using the website feels smooth and enjoyable, just like moving around in a well-designed house.

### 🎨 User Interaction (UI) - Designing the House's Controls
UI is all about making the buttons and cool stuff on the website. It's like creating easy-to-click, good-looking controls, similar to designing a game controller. In web development, UI ensures the website is not just functional but also visually appealing and easy to navigate. 

So, UX makes the website feel great, and UI makes it look awesome and easy to play around with. 🖱️💻✨
