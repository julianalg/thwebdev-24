Okay, imagine your favorite LEGO action figure as a cool website or app. The way it looks and feels when you play with it is like the front end. Now, let's break it down into three main components:

![HTML and CSS and JavaScript side by side](https://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/javascript-seo/5948abfc0e2df5.02876591.gif)

Now, what is each of these components for, and what role does each component play in front end development?

### HTML - The skeleton of the website

Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML, is the blueprint for your LEGO action figure. It tells you how to put everything together and what each part is. If your action figure has a head, body, arms, and legs, HTML is the guide that says, "Put the head on top, connect the arms to the body, and attach the legs at the bottom." It's all about putting together the different pieces so that the figure (or website) looks the way you want it to!

### CSS - What makes the website look pretty

Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the paint and accessories for your LEGO figure. Once you've built the figure following the blueprint (HTML), CSS lets you decide how awesome it will look. Imagine giving your action figure a vibrant superhero costume, a shiny robot exterior, or a glittery princess dress—that's what CSS does for your website! It's the style master that adds colors and patterns to make your LEGO figure stand out and look super awesome!

### JavaScript - Allows users to interact with the website

JavaScript is the superpowers for your LEGO figure. Once you've built it (HTML) and styled it (CSS), JavaScript comes in to make it move and do amazing things. Imagine your action figure doing flips, karate kicks, or dancing—it's all thanks to JavaScript. So, when you click a button on a website and something cool happens, like a game starting or a video playing, that's JavaScript working its magical superpowers to bring your creation to life!
