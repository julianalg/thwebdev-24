The Frontend can be described as what you see when you visit your favorite website. Whenever you watch YouTube or go on Instagram, what you are looking at is considered the front end of the website or app. The front end can be broken down into three main components:

### HTML - The skeleton of the website

Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, provides the elements that you need for a website. We consider it the skeleton of the website because it provides the basic but essential components that a website and its webpages need. This ranges from text, images, buttons, etc. A basic HTML website can look like this:

### CSS - What makes the website look pretty

Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is what makes the website stand out in terms of style. It allows you to take basic HTML code and style it in any way that you want, which is why text can have different colors and fonts, buttons can have different styles with rounded curves, etc. Down below is DuckDuckGo with and without CSS

### JavaScript - Allows users to interact with the website

JavaScript is what makes a website dynamic and interactive. It takes a static HTML and CSS coded website and allows the user to interact with the elements on the website. It allows you to add animations and other interactive elements within your website. As you will see later, JavaScript can also be used for the back end, which is the code that runs in the background while you interact with the website
