Welcome to Triton Hacks - your gateway to coding and tech exploration! This is the starter kit for those who want to learn about web development and how we can create websites!

Get set for an exciting journey through some awesome modules that'll show you everything about the internet, how websites operate, and how they're built. On the left, you'll see three main modules, and there's a special one where you'll see how we create a website using these concepts. At the bottom of each page, you'll find links to smoothly move to the next or previous submodule, making it super easy to keep learning. Start from the top module and explore downwards, but if you're already confident, feel free to dive into the modules you're most interested in. If you ever feel lost, just use the search bar to quickly find what you're looking forâ€”it'll guide you straight there! Get ready for an incredible learning adventureâ€”it's going to be awesome! ðŸš€âœ¨
